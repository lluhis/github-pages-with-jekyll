# WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. You lived before you met me?! There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! No argument here. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?

Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Kids have names? __Check it out, y'all.__ *Everyone who was invited is here.* Soothe us with sweet lies.

## Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

I wish! It's a nickel. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Who are those horrible orange men? And when we woke up, we had these bodies.

1. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
2. Tell them I hate them.
3. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suitâ€¦ that's why I'm transferring to business school!

### With gusto.

Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! I'm Santa Claus!

* Throw her in the brig.
* Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!
* Why did you bring us here?

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Who are you, my warranty?!

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? But I've never been to the moon! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Bender, you risked your life to save me! Meh. I don't want to be rescued. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Look, last night was a mistake.

Oh, I think we should just stay friends. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Throw her in the brig. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"!

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Really?! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!

It's toe-tappingly tragic! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Bite my shiny metal ass. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

I can explain. It's very valuable. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid.

Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?

I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. She also liked to shut up! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.
